The Google Cloud Certified - Professional Cloud Architect exam assesses your ability to:

- Design and plan a cloud solution architecture
- Manage and provision the cloud solution infrastructure
- Design for security and compliance
- Analyze and optimize technical and business processes
- Manage implementations of cloud architecture
- Ensure solution and operations reliability


## Certification Exam Guide

### Section 1: Designing and planning a cloud solution architecture
1.1 Designing a solution infrastructure that meets business requirements. Considerations include:
- business use cases and product strategy
- cost optimization
- supporting the application design
- integration
- movement of data
- tradeoffs
- build, buy or modify
- success measurements (e.g., Key Performance Indicators (KPI), Return on Investment (ROI), metrics)
- Compliance and observability

1.2 Designing a solution infrastructure that meets technical requirements. Considerations include:
- high availability and failover design
- elasticity of cloud resources
- scalability to meet growth requirements

1.3 Designing network, storage, and compute resources. Considerations include:
- integration with on premises/multi-cloud environments
- Cloud native networking (VPC, peering, firewalls, container networking)
- identification of data processing pipeline
- matching data characteristics to storage systems
- data flow diagrams
- storage system structure (e.g., Object, File, RDBMS, NoSQL, NewSQL)
- mapping compute needs to platform products

1.4 Creating a migration plan (i.e., documents and architectural diagrams). Considerations include:
- integrating solution with existing systems
- migrating systems and data to support the solution
- licensing mapping
- network and management planning
- testing and proof-of-concept

1.5 Envisioning future solution improvements. Considerations include:
- cloud and technology improvements
- business needs evolution
- evangelism and advocacy

### Section 2: Managing and provisioning solution Infrastructure
2.1 Configuring network topologies. Considerations include:

- extending to on-premise (hybrid networking)
- extending to a multi-cloud environment which may include GCP to GCP communication
- security
- data protection

2.2 Configuring individual storage systems. Considerations include:
- data storage allocation
- data processing/compute provisioning
- security and access management
- network configuration for data transfer and latency
- data retention and data lifecycle management
- data growth management
